# Binarized Neural Networks

This is an implementation of binarized neural networks using Tensorflow. Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830

## Starting Training

It's possible to start training networks on Cifar or MNIST datasets. At the end a plot about performance is printed. 
One can edit parameters inside each script.
### How to do it
```
python MNISTtrain.py or python cifarTrain.py
```

## Built With
